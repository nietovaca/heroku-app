NOTES:
Definitely struggled with my vision matching my ability in this app. Started with big ideas and ended up with a very simple CRUD app. Some things I would like to improve upon as I continue my learning journey:
- Schema for standards that tracks data for each student
  - Is there a way to make each standard save as a variable and then call on it for other use?
  - Query for student progress over one standard over time
  - Query for class progress over one standard over time
- Complex input to data (ie. dropdown to select, log changes)
- Color change after student participation/when students participate more than once
- Table sort for those who were most recently updated to move to bottom of class list
